# WSL-Tools

Scripts and tools I use with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) in Winddows 10. **These tools are for WSL1, not tested in WSL2**

- `configure-docker.sh` - Script to configure the Linux Docker client for a Docker host created with Docker Machine. Usage described on my blog: [My Docker workflow in Windows Subsystem for Linux](http://blog.jreypo.io/containers/microsoft/windows%2010/my-docker-workflow-in-wsl/).
- `vssh.sh` - Script to allow a similar experience to `vagrant ssh` from WSL. Usage described on my blog: [Vagrant ssh in Windows 10 from WSL](http://blog.jreypo.io/devops/microsoft/windows%2010/vagrant-ssh-in-windows-10-from-wsl/).
